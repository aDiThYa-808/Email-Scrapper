Dear Researcher,

Greetings from Barcode Biotechnology!

We are excited to announce our upcoming Hands-on Training in DNA Sequence Analysis (7th–11th August 2025) – a focused online program designed to help students and researchers master Sanger sequencing data analysis step-by-step.

This industry-relevant training covers:
✅ Chromatogram editing (Chromas Pro)
✅ Sequence extraction & consensus building (BioEdit)
✅ BLASTn-based species identification
✅ Multiple sequence alignment (ClustalX)
✅ Phylogenetic analysis & distance estimation (MEGA)

By nominating your students, interns, or research scholars, you can:

Enhance the analytical capabilities of your lab

Ensure your team gains publishable-quality phylogenetic skills

Save time on data troubleshooting and improve project outcomes

Build a stronger research foundation for upcoming publications

🎓 No prior bioinformatics expertise is required, making it suitable for UG, PG, PhD, Post-docs, and faculty.
📜 Participants will receive a Certificate of Completion – a valuable addition to their research profile.

The training fee is just ₹370, making it an affordable way to upgrade your team’s molecular analysis expertise.

📌 Seats are limited & the deadline is 5th August!

I would be delighted if you could encourage your students to enroll and strengthen the research skillset of your lab.
